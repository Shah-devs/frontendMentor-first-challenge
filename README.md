## frontendMentor-first-challenge
just warming up

#used only HTML and CSS#
CSS felx layout
good exercise to challenge, test and try different flex layout properties and values such as grow shrink and flex-basis
undeerstand the main axis and cross axis concept, set *flex-direction: column* and centered item respectively using justify-content and justify-items!
nothing much about HTML, just section and containers with specific classes to help creating and adjusting the flex layout
